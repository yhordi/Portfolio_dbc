      <p class="text">I'm a full stack developer primarily familiar with the Rails stack. I've gotten the building blocks of my experience from Dev Bootcamp San Francisco, though I am always pushing myself to learn new technologies. at DBC I learned Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, MVC Javascript, AJAX, JS Frameworks (Jquery, Mustache, Handlebars), HTML5/CSS3, Test Driven Development, OO Design, Git/GitHub, Database Design(MySQL, ActiveRecord using PostGres), Agile Project Methodologies, and Pair Programming. I also learned about the importance of testing and I am familiar with Jasmine, Capybara, and Rspec testing frameworks. Below are some of the projects I worked on while at DBC.

    <div class="bootTrack">
      <div class="description">
        <a href='http://boot-track.herokuapp.com/'>BootTrack</a> is an app that allows prospective <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> students to make human connections in a fast and easy way. Users can find and contact current and past DBC students in order to learn more about the program from a student's point-of-view. The app is built on a Ruby on Rails stack with a thick client using MustacheJS, AJAX, HTML 5, and SASS. The app uses a variety of Google apis, as well as the LinkedIn and DBC apis. Boottrack is a heavily tested app using Jasmine, Rspec, and Capybara testing frameworks.

    <div class="wackOverflow" >
      <div class="description">
        <a href="http://wackoverflow.herokuapp.com/">Wackoverflow</a> is a stack overflow clone featuring similar functionality. The team worked together on all parts of the app and later pairs focused on specific features together. I worked largely on the front end, building partials using embedded ruby and styling the app with vanilla CSS

    <div class="missionTracker">
      <div class="description">
        MissionTracker is a work-in-progress gamified to-do list. The main idea behind it is that your todos follow a procedurally generated narrative. I wanted to build something that would get me some practice with some of the more advanced css methods like transitions.

        Before I attended Dev Bootcamp I took <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">thinkful</a>'s four month frontend course and was awarded a <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/student/jordan-kamin/certificates/front-end-web-development">cerification</a> in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and design.
